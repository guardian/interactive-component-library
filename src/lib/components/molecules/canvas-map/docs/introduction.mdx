# Introduction

## ðŸ§­ Why does this component exist?

For election result pages we require a particular kind of map. It's not as simple as a basic [SVG map](?path=/docs/molecules-svgmap-getting-started--documentation), because we want readers to be able to zoom and pan. But it also doesn't warrant a fully-fledged WebGL-rendered [slippy map](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/sep/21/liverpool-real-madrid-paris-stade-de-france-champions-league).

What we need is something in between. A solution that can render election-style maps efficiently (including pan and zoom functionality), without slowing down page load, which can affect how our election results pages are ranked in search engines.

In the past we would build every election map from scratch using d3, which was both time-consuming and error-prone. The aim here is to make that process easier.

### Bundle size

Here's how our solution stacks up against popular mapping libraries MapLibre and OpenLayers in terms of bundle size (and therefore page load).

| Mapping solution | bundle size[^1]  | gzipped | relative size |
| :- | -: | -: | -: |
| Map component | 253.45 kB   | 62.54 kB  | 1x |
| OpenLayers    | 881.72 kB   | 185.51 kB | 3x |
| MapLibre      | 1,391.17 kB | 308.69 kB | 5x |
