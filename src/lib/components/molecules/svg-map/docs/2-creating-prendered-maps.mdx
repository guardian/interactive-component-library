# SVGMap

## When to prerender an SVG map

Pre-rendering maps can be a good solution when you have lots of identical maps in a page and want to reduce the rendering 
work your page is doing, ie avoiding re-rendering the same topojson file several times over. An example use case is locator maps: eg locating different states on the same underlying map of the US 12 times over. 

If you just need one or two maps on a page the performance gain you'll get from pre-rendering is less significant. 

## Getting started

1. First create a simple Polygon map of the correct area, with the right bounds and projections. If you do this in the `polygon.stories.jsx` file, 
you can use the interface in the components library that allows you to download an SVG. But this can also be done in a client repo. 

See Getting Started for how to create a simple Polygon Map. You will need to load some geography from a [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) file. And add configuration 

** QUESTION: when should you use geoIdentity() vs a standard projection eg Albers? 


2. Check the resulting SVG looks how you want. If so, you can use the Download SVG button in the component library, or else inspect and download the 
resulting SVG from the repo where you have created it. You could just use a pre-created SVG, but it is helpful to do this step so
the underlying map will be compatible with other layers from the component library. 


3. Upload the SVG file to the assets directory of the project where you want to use the map. 
Use the Prerendered Layer and point its url attribute to the SVG map you have just created. `<MapLayers.Prerendered url={usAsset} />` 
The layer should be a child of the `<SVGMap>` component.
See below:


<Source dark={true} code={`
// LocatorMap.jsx
import { SVGMap, MapLayers } from "@guardian/interactive-component-library"
import { geoAlbersUsa } from "d3-geo"

export const LocatorMap = ({ state, centroid = "test" }) => {

  let mapArgs = {
    name: "US locator",
    id: "map",
    config: { 
      projection: geoAlbersUsa().scale(1300).translate([487.5, 305]), 
      drawCompositionBorders: false,
      bounds: [
        [-57.66491068874468, 12.97635452036684],
        [957.5235629133763, 606.5694262668667]
      ]
    },
    padding: {
      top: 0,
      right: 0,
      bottom: 0,
      left: 0,
    },
    drawToCanvas: false,
    width: 100,
    height: 61,
  }

  const usAsset = "__assetsPath__/geo/us-states.svg"

  return (
    <SVGMap {...mapArgs}>
      <MapLayers.Prerendered url={usAsset} />
    </SVGMap>
  )
}

`} />

NB: in the mapArgs, the [projection](https://github.com/topojson/us-atlas?tab=readme-ov-file#us-atlas-topojson) is specified by the maker of the topojson.
The bounds come from the bbox property in the original topojson.


4. Adding a point layer. To pinpoint eg a state on this pre-rendered map, get the co-ordinates of the point you wish to highlight. 
Bear in mind that location coordinates are conventionally given as lat-lons, but in d3, coordinates are written as lon-lats, 
so you will need switch the numbers around. 
NB: the property given to features must be an array. 


<Source dark={true} code={`

 const pointFeature = {
    type: "Feature",
    properties: {},
    geometry: {
      coordinates: [-83.441162, 33.247875],
      type: "Point",
    },
  }

  const usAsset = "__assetsPath__/geo/us-states.svg"

  return (
    <SVGMap {...mapArgs}>
      <MapLayers.Prerendered url={usAsset} styles={styles} />
      <MapLayers.Point features={[pointFeature]} fill={'red'} stroke-width={2} radius={10}/>
    </SVGMap>
  )

  `} />
